A young man with short brown hair and a toned physique, now wearing the black hoodie featuring a bold, red graffiti-like pattern (as shown in the provided image). The background remains the same lush, green forest setting from his original photo, with softly blurred trees that create a calm, natural atmosphere. He stands in a relaxed posture, the hoodie’s vivid design contrasting against the greenery. The video begins with him facing the camera directly, giving a clear view of the hoodie’s front. He then smoothly pivots to his right, gradually revealing the side profile and, eventually, the back of the garment. His expression is neutral yet confident throughout, and his movements are unhurried, allowing the viewer to appreciate the hoodie’s details and fit. The soft, natural lighting emphasizes both the subject’s features and the striking pattern on the hoodie, maintaining a balanced focus on the person and the setting.
