A person wearing a long-sleeve top with a peplum design, featuring blue and white horizontal stripes with flared sleeves, paired with a white skirt with vertical black stripes, knee-length with belt loops and front pockets. They keep other garments the same: a black zip-up sweater underneath a salmon-colored puffer vest, and black ankle boots.

Their appearance includes curly dark brown hair and a neutral facial expression. They mime the motion of standing and walking in a studio, shifting from a side profile to front-facing, occasionally adjusting their hair.

The background is completely white, with soft studio lighting creating slight shadows on the smooth, plain floor. The setting is minimalist, simple, and clean, with no other objects or people in the scene.
