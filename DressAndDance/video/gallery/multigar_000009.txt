A woman with her hair styled in a sleek high ponytail, wearing a white long sleeve top with a button-down front and adorned with colorful embroidered animals and floral patterns in a loose fit. She pairs this with blue denim jeans featuring a faded wash effect, a five-pocket design, and button and zipper closure. She maintains an upright posture, exhibiting a right side profile, and performs a 360-degree rotation by turning her head and body from right to left and back, allowing for full visibility of the garments. Her skin tone is medium and her facial expression is calm and focused. She wears teal-green strappy high-heeled sandals that wrap around the ankles. The background is a minimalist and evenly lit white studio setting, devoid of shadows, focused on a contemporary fashion presentation. The environment is simple and unobtrusive, maintaining the attention on her and the outfit.
