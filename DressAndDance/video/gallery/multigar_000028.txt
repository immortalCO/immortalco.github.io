A woman wears a beige short sleeve top with an open front design and intricate black embroidery on the chest, paired with a vibrant skirt featuring a mix of yellow and pink floral patterns in a flared design. She maintains her natural wavy hair and facial features as depicted. The woman poses in various stances: standing front-facing, slight side angles, and back-facing, with a relaxed posture and one hand casually resting by her side or in a position reminiscent of being in a pocket. The setting is a white room with seamless walls, creating a clean and modern look, identical to the original image environment. Blue platform sandals complete the outfit for a balanced yet striking ensemble.
