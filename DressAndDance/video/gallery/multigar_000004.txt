A female model with long, straight dark hair and bangs is wearing a black sleeveless top with lace fabric and floral patterns, featuring a scalloped hem and thin shoulder straps. She pairs this with a long, black skirt with white floral patterns and a layered, flowing design. The model wears the same black sneakers visible from the appearance reference.

In the video, she walks forward gracefully, arms relaxed at her sides, with a slight sway in motion. She turns to the left side view in one frame and ends with her back facing the camera, maintaining a relaxed posture throughout.

The background is a minimalistic, softly lit studio space with a seamless white floor and neutrally colored surroundings. Every element of the setting emphasizes cleanliness and simplicity, complementing the fashionable and artistic style of the outfit.
