A woman with straight black hair, wearing a sleeveless dress featuring a vibrant fruit and leaf pattern with oranges, lemons, and green leaves, smocked bodice, and ruffled hem. Over the dress, she has an earthy brown oversized cardigan unzipped, combined with dark olive green wide-legged pants extending below the dress hem. She sports black slip-on shoes. The setting is a minimalist studio with a plain white background and soft lighting. The model's movements are smooth and graceful, transitioning between frontal and slightly side views, hands occasionally in pockets or gently adjusting her hair. The overall atmosphere is sleek, clean, and contemporary, with a focus on the outfit's playful yet sophisticated combination.
