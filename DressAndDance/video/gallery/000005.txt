A woman standing and walking with smooth, confident movements, performs a motion of transitioning from facing forward to walking away. She wears an A-line skirt with a black and white checkered pattern, featuring a ruffled hem. Paired with the skirt, she has a white blouse beneath a burgundy oversized sweater, and patterned flats. Her appearance includes long dark hair, minimal makeup, and a medium build. The background is a minimalistic studio with white walls and a plain floor, ample lighting ensuring no shadows, maintaining focus on her and her clothing.
