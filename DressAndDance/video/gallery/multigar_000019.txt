A woman with long, dark hair and a neutral expression, wearing a white short sleeve top featuring a printed artwork of flowers in a vase, labeled "Irises" with "VINCENT VAN GOGH" below, is paired with short pants showcasing a floral pattern in blue, white, and beige with an elastic waistband and drawstring. The woman holds a decorative handbag in her hand. She stands in a smooth transition, turning from a front-facing position to a side view and then back, showcasing a balanced, full-length body shot. 

The background is a minimalistic white setting, with soft lighting that emphasizes the details on the garments. The environment remains clean and modern, focusing on the artistic yet casual appearance of the ensemble.
