One person wearing a short sleeve top with a complex color pattern featuring a mix of blue, white, and brown hues, depicting a tiger and floral design, paired with a pink skirt with black vertical and horizontal stripes, button details along the front, and faux pocket designs. The person maintains the same appearance: fair skin, blonde hair styled in a sleek updo, wearing dark sunglasses. The setting is a minimalist studio with soft, evenly lit white backdrop, no additional elements or props. The person moves gracefully, transitioning from standing with one hand by the side and the other slightly bent, to facing front, then slightly turning and walking. This emphasizes the sleek, modern elegance of the attire, while maintaining focus on the garments' texture and silhouette throughout the motion.
