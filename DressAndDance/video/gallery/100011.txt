Woman wearing a long sleeve dress with a black and white abstract pattern, featuring a wrap design with a side tie, elegant and modern. Her hair is long and straight, wearing chunky black sunglasses and cream slide sandals. The setting is a minimalistic white space with a seamless floor and walls, creating a clean, studio-like atmosphere. The video captures her gracefully dancing Latin steps, turning from facing forward to her left side, showing the profile of the dress, highlighting its clean lines and elegant cut. She continues rotating as part of her dance to give a full view of the back, then completes the turn to face away, showing the right profile before returning to the original frontal position. The neutral environment and her sophisticated appearance emphasize the dress's abstract design.
