A young man with short, trimmed hair and a neat beard, fair skin tone, wearing a long sleeve top with a zip-up front, featuring a repeating high-frequency pattern of horizontal stripes in multiple colors including yellow, red, blue, and green. Paired with dark fitted jeans and navy sneakers for a casual, yet stylish look. Background is a simple, plain white setting, providing a clean and unobtrusive environment. The man's motion transitions smoothly; he starts dancing cucarachas with a steady rhythm, pausing to a relaxed standing pose with hands by his sides, occasionally turning to reveal the back, before resuming his dance. His expression remains calm and poised throughout, allowing the focus to remain on the vibrant patterns of the garment.
